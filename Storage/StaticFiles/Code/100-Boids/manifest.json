  "Tip": "Use the Boids simulation as a stress test.",
  "Summary": {
"What": "Boids is a simulation of flocking birds that show the impact of large numbers of shapes on performance.",
"Why": "Model / shape seperation is important for future integrations but can degrade performance. So ongoing performance testing is important.",
"How": "All boids must recalculate their position and velocity every frame, which is very demanding. "
