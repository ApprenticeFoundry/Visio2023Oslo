  "Summary": {
    "What": "Boids is a simulation of flocking birds that shows the impact of large numbers of shapes on performance.",
    "Why": "Model / shape separation is important for future integrations but can degrade performance, so ongoing performance testing is important.",
    "How": "All boids must recalculate their position and velocity every frame, which is very demanding. "
