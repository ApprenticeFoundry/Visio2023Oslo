  "Tip": "1D glue requires a non-rendered 'Glue' object that links the 1D source to the 2D target.",
  "Summary": {
    "What": "When the target shape is moved, all 1D shapes that are glued to it must are notified and modified.",
    "Why": "1D shapes must adjust their position and orientation to stay connected in the diagram.",
    "How": "Let the 1D shape own the glue, then notify the glue every time the target shape is moved so the 1D shape can adjust itself."
