  "Tip": "1D glue requires a 'Glue' object the links the source to the target.",
  "Summary": {
    "What": "When the target shape is moved, other shapes that own the 'glue' to it must be notified and modified.",
    "Why": "1D shapes must adjust there position and orientation to stay connected in the diagram.",
    "How": "Let the 1D shape own the glue, then notify the glue every time the target shapes is moved so it can adjust the 1D shape."
