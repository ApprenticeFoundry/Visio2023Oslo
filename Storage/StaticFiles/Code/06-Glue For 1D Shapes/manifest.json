  "Status": "MustSee",
  "ImageURL": "{Path}/glue.gif",
  "Badge": "Model Relationships",
  "Description": "1D and 2D 'Glue' will adjust other shapes as a result of moving the selected shape",
  "Tip": "1D Glue requires the shape to reference another. Do this through an intermediary object the links the source and target.",
  "Summary": {
    "What": "When the target shape is moved, other shapes that own the 'glue' to it must be notified and modified.",
    "Why": "1D shapes must adjust there position and orientation to stay connected in the diagram.",
    "How": "let the 1D shape own the glue, then notify the glue every time the target shapes is moved so it can adjust the 1D shape."
