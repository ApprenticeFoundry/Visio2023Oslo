  "Tip": "Create a class that 'wraps' a shape to orchestrate the arrangement of horizontal and vertical trees.",
  "MemeURL": "{Path}/layoutpop.gif",
  "Summary": {
    "What": "Trees are hierarchical arrangements of shapes and very common in diagrams.",
    "Why": "Automated layout is helpful, because tree modifications can impact the entire drawing.",
    "How": "Class FoLayoutTree<Shape2D> uses parent/child relationships to compute the size and location of each branch."
