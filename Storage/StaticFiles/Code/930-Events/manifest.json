  "Summary": {
    "What": "Treat every event as a message with a topic, avoid doing a direct function call to another component.",
    "Why": "Pub/Sub promotes loose coupling. The Message object simplifies recording/playback scenarios and testing.",
    "How": "Use a Topic / Message structure to share event data, then leverage the BlazorComponentBus service"
